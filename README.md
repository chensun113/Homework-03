# Homework-03
  This is for week03 homework. This is very difficult for me. 
  At first, I started to connecting css and js files. Then,the onclick function of the button has been created. I understand the "addEventListener" is the same as <button onclick="">, but I am not used to use it. Using Math.random() and Math.floor() to choose characters randomly. 
  There are total two functions, one is called writePassword(), which controls final presenting. It calls another one generatePassword()by setting it as a varable. In writePassword(), there is a "if" statement to judge wheather the W function assets as command. Then, it outputs the password.
  More specific, there is a alert to judge and make sure there should be at least one criteria. If four conditions are all "false". It should try again.
